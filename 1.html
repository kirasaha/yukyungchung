						In last semester, my keyword of work was translation. I translated sound into paintings. In the midterm, I
 						focused on improvising the sound I hear. In final project, I made my own rules and compared paintings that what I focused on Intuition and when the rules are added.
						<br>In this semester, I’ll experiment something that I’ve never tried before.  I won’t paint. I mean I don’t draw with a real paints and roller ect. What I’ll do in this semester is real time generative paintings. And I will reconstruct the invisible elements to be visible.

					<br>
					<br>
					What topic?<br>

					The keywords that I'm interested are,<br>
					First is space. The definition of space is empty place with nothing. But, However, whether indoors or outdoors, space is filled with something such as objects, air. I means there are visible things are in the space and and also invisible elements are exist. What I’m interested is invisible elements that compose space such as temperature, humidity sound and light.
					Because I think the invisible makes up more space than the visible, and it's interesting that they keep changing in the same space.


					So, I’ll collect invisible element which are in the space and I’ll collect each data.
					And I’ll make each data visible on a Web canvas.

					For example, I’ll firstly collect data of temperature and apply rule1 and then collect humidity data and apply rule 2 and going on in this process.

					And then each outcome is layering and appearing on a canvas.
 
					<br><br>
					The second keyword is present. The criteria of present is changing according to time. I’m interested in capturing and collecting that represents present.
					So, I’ll connect a device that’ll collect invisible elements in the space. As soon as each web receive a data, I’ll draw something based on the rule I make.

					So, I can capture that each data is layering in a real time.

					And I also have to decide from when to when to observe.
					I need to think about it.

					So to sum up, my work for this semester is collect invisible data of the current space and visualize that data by substituting it into my own rules.



					And I need to think about which space I’ll draw.<br><br>
					And I’m considering 2 ways of process.
					First is drawing same space. It is to analyze the same place by setting the time and data. Because invisible elements and present change with time.
					Second is drawing different spaces. Of course, since all conditions are different, even with the same rule, different results will appear significantly.
